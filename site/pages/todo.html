    Sitix is still a pretty young piece of software, so if there's a missing feature that isn't on this list, don't hesitate to submit a feature request on <a href="https://github.com/LinuxRocks2000/sitix-rewrite/issues">the issues page</a>.
    Alternatively, you could just write it yourself! This TODO list is mostly for my memory, but I would love codebase contributions to get some things crossed off.

    <ul>
        <li>Stress-test seggies (maybe build a large "stresstest" project that uses the most cursed possible permutations of all the sitix features).</li>
        <li>Safety: Sitix should not delete your entire codebase if you accidentally mistype the command.</li>
        <li>Use Evals more widely and implement string manipulation.</li>
    </ul>
