    Sitix is still a pretty young piece of software, so if there's a missing feature that isn't on this list, don't hesitate to submit a feature request on <a href="https://github.com/LinuxRocks2000/sitix-rewrite/issues">the issues page</a>.
    Alternatively, you could just write it yourself! This TODO list is mostly for my memory, but I would love codebase contributions to get some things crossed off.

    <ul>
        <li>Markdown support with an @-directive</li>
        <li>Code cleaning (need to fix memory management especially)</li>
        <li>Make config less hack (move from \[i config] to \[i exists], and create empty objects on global with -c)</li>
        <li>Add an unpack/ghost operator so setting objects to other objects works (something like \[=ghostingName-] \[%ghostedObject] \[/])</li>
    </ul>
