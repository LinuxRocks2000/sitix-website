    This is where I'll post miscellaneous notes on Sitix stuff. If you're using Sitix (or just interested in the project), you should check back here
    periodically for information on new releases, design considerations, known bugs, etc. You can think of it as a miniblog.

    <b>2024-3-23:</b> Added Evals. It's a simple evaluated stack-based language designed specifically for Sitix. At the moment, all it does is compare things, but it's
    a damn sight better than how if statements used to work. Eventually I'll add vscript to inline object (<code>\[=name content]</code>) directives; for now, 
    it's present in if statements and the <code>\[v]</code> directive.<br>
    In other news, the program is a LOT cleaner now. Much of the processing effort has been moved into constructors and a lot of things have been simplified and
    abstracted. Memory maps are now automatically unmapped and have a very pleasant buffer-like interface, and all the mapping code has been moved to a single function.<br>
    The project is now ready for MarkDown!<br>
    <b>Slightly later in the day:</b> Added markdown! It's not quite ready for production yet, but works promisingly well already.
    <br><br>
    <b>2024-3-11:</b> Model updates, and now this site can actually be built by the latest sitix updates :D.<br>
    As of today, Sitix now leaks no memory when building this site! It took a lot of effort to trim down but it was worth it. We shall see if the luck persists.
    <br><br>
    <b>2024-3-10:</b> Now the project-object model is a LOT better. When a lookup fails for something that is also a valid filename, that file is loaded as an object
    (so subsequent lookups will find it). This means it's possible to replicate the behavior of \[#file] with \[^file], although because of child-access you need to
    escape the filename (like <code>\[^directory/file\\.html]</code>). The latter also allows accessing objects inside a file without rendering that file. The old include
    syntax now just sets up a dereference and escapes the name for you.<br>
    Memory management is a <i>pain</i>. The reasons are complex, but it's mostly because of what I call the "crap-copy"; if you're interested, look for that phrase in
    the code comments. I added some frees and deletes but Valgrind tells me it's still leaking quite a bit, especially when for loops are used.

    <b>2024-3-9:</b> The stupid "Something has gone terribly wrong" warning is NOT important; you can safely ignore it. It's just debugging information pour moi.
