    This is where I'll post miscellaneous notes on Sitix stuff. If you're using Sitix (or just interested in the project), you should check back here
    periodically for information on new releases, design considerations, known bugs, etc. You can think of it as a miniblog.

    <b>2024-3-11:</b> Model updates, and now this site can actually be built by the latest sitix updates :D.

    <b>2024-3-10:</b> Now the project-object model is a LOT better. When a lookup fails for something that is also a valid filename, that file is loaded as an object
    (so subsequent lookups will find it). This means it's possible to replicate the behavior of \[#file] with \[^file], although because of child-access you need to
    escape the filename (like <code>\[^directory/file\\.html]</code>). The latter also allows accessing objects inside a file without rendering that file. The old include
    syntax now just sets up a dereference and escapes the name for you.<br>
    Memory management is a <i>pain</i>. The reasons are complex, but it's mostly because of what I call the "crap-copy"; if you're interested, look for that phrase in
    the code comments. I added some frees and deletes but Valgrind tells me it's still leaking quite a bit, especially when for loops are used.

    <b>2024-3-9:</b> The stupid "Something has gone terribly wrong" warning is NOT important; you can safely ignore it. It's just debugging information pour moi.
