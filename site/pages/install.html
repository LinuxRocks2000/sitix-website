<div class="text">
    At the moment, Sitix has no prebuilt binaries; I hope to include RPM/DEB packages in the next release.<br>To install it, you'll need to clone
    <a href="https://github.com/LinuxRocks2000/sitix-rewrite">the Github repository</a>, run <code>./build.sh</code>, and (assuming the build completes successfully)
    copy the generated <code>sitix</code> binary to some PATH-accessible location (<code>/usr/bin</code> is a good bet). Sitix requires a C++20-compatible
    G++ installation; it has no other dependencies. Sitix is theoretically cross-compilable to Windows, but I have no intention of ever officially supporting Windows.

    Once you've got Sitix installed, see <a href="[^baseurl]/pages/usage">Usage</a>.
