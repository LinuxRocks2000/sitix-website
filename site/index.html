<h1>Sitix</h1>
<div class="text toptext">
    Sitix is a modern SSG (Static Site Generator) that allows you total control over how your project is assembled, without sacrificing ease. It uses an object/scope
    model with efficient file includes, conditional branching, looping, and command-line configuration to make stunning websites without the mess. 
</div>

    Template all the things. Any Sitix file can be a template; the \[?] opening phrase indicates that (for whatever reason) the file shouldn't be rendered normally,
    but still may be included in other files - for configuration, templating, or even modular elements!

    Sitix is a universal preprocessor. HTML? Of course. CSS? Yep! JavaScript? Certainly! Sitix will template anything, whether it be a nice simple HTML file or a hand-edited GIF
    from 1998. Say goodbye to annoying configuration discrepancies between CSS and HTML and JavaScript - just throw your shared variables in a config.stx file and let Sitix do the rest!

<div class="text scrolly" style="font-size: 2em;">
    No more restrictive project structures, irritating configuration files, or <b>magic</b>. Goodbye Ruby, "blog-awareness", difficult configuration, and bulky outputs.
    Sayonara obtuse frameworks, inefficient CSR, and annoying configuration.
    Sitix renders <b>what you want, when you want it,</b> and doesn't ask questions.

    Like what you see? <a href="[^baseurl]/pages/install">install Sitix</a> and start building modern websites now!
